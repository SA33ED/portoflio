            <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              I fell in love with mobile engineering during my CS degree. While classmates were still building tutorials,
              I was shipping real apps — solving messy problems like offline sync, real-time chat, and complex
              multi-role systems.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Today I work as a Flutter Developer at <span className="text-foreground font-medium">evyx</span>, owning
              features end-to-end on large-scale products. I obsess over architecture decisions, performance budgets,
              and the small UX details that make apps feel <span className="text-foreground">premium</span>.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Beyond client work, I run <span className="text-foreground font-medium"> HappyTech</span> — a YouTube
              channel teaching modern Flutter to a growing community of developers.
